### **Abstract**
This research presents an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed for the precise visualization of concealed infrastructure, such as underground utilities and in-wall wiring, within real-world building environments. Leveraging markerless AR technology integrated with the FLX alignment system, our approach enables accurate overlapping of a 3D BIM model onto a physical structure. This allows users to perceive hidden building components with an "XR ray vision" effect, providing critical insights into inaccessible areas like pipes and manholes. Developed using Unity and ARCore/ARFoundation, the application employs advanced geospatial alignment techniques to achieve centimeter-level accuracy for BIM model projection, eliminating the need for traditional marker-based alignment. Key functionalities include real-time model overlay, interactive visibility controls for different utility layers, and precise spatial registration. Our work specifically addresses the challenge of accurately mapping digital infrastructure models to their physical counterparts in dynamic environments. Preliminary results demonstrate successful and accurate visualization of underground and in-wall elements, significantly enhancing facility management, maintenance, and construction planning.
